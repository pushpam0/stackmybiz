How to run app:
register through gmail or any valid email id
verification link will sent on you email id
you can go to the home page without verifying email but you will be unverified on home page 
if you verify your account while opening home page your status will be changed on live 
timer countinue running on home page 
at every 5 sec your location added on the firebase and lat lang you can clearly see on home page that will be updated on every 5 sec.
if you go back timer will stop and no location updated on firebase
if you forgot your password click on forgot password and reset link will be forwarded on your email account just click on it and reset.
at any time you are not stoped to go on home page any updation on profile will be live tracked on home page.
app will run on any size android deivice in any orientation.

reference:
firebase documentation for all kind of firebase problem 
gecoding and geolocator pub.dev reference
and few public artical.

I tried to keep code clean and formattable at the beginning but due to sortage of timing 
i have written lot of thing at the place where i needed like color code, popup etc sorry for that.

i hope you find my work productive.
Thank you.
